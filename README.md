## Overview

The main challenge was to transform a static, manual pricing strategy into a responsive, automated system with a human-in-the-loop (HiTL), creating a market-driven approach for both setting and responding to ticket prices per game.

To illustrate how the system directly addresses key business challenges, the following table maps each identified pain point to its corresponding solution:

| üö© Problem | üí° Solution |
| :--------------------------- | :---------------------------- |
| **Static pricing**: Prices were set once per season in rigid, inflexible categories (e.g., A++, A, B), then updated weekly/monthly. | **Dynamic recommendations**: Generates price proposals for each seating zone based on near real-time data analysis, allowing for daily updates. |
| **Manual adjustments**: The team would slowly analyze various metrics to manually propose price changes. | **Impact simulation**: Instantly models the projected impact of any price change on revenue and ticket sales. |
| **Data bottleneck**: Extracting data manually from fragmented systems was slow and operationally complex. | **Centralized data**: Automatically aggregates all key data points ‚Äìsales, web analytics, contextual data, etc.‚Äì into one place. |
| **Slow implementation**: The process to act on a decision was manual and disconnected from the sales platform. | **Seamless integration**: Allows for one-click approval on a dashboard, which triggers a price update to the live ticketing system via REST API. |

The diagram below illustrates the project's conceptual framework. The system acts as the central *brain* to balance the goals of The Club and The Fan. It operates in a continuous loop by ingesting internal and external factors to forecast demand at various price points. The **Decision Engine** then uses this forecast to recommend an optimal price.

## Architecture

The general workflow is as follows:
1. **Data Sources** are collected and fed into the central engine.
2. The **Dynamic Pricing Engine** uses machine learning models and business rules to generate a price recommendation.
3. The pricing team uses the **UI & Integration** layer to review, simulate, and approve the price, which is then updated in the live ticketing system.

## Dataset

To showcase the model's capabilities, this repository uses a synthetically generated dataset. This dataset is not random data; it is engineered to mirror the complexity, scale, and statistical properties of a real-world ticketing environment for a top-tier football club.

The dataset simulates:

* **A focused set of matches:** It contains data for **10 unique matches**, representing a diverse sample of fixtures including league, cup, and international games.
* **Complete sales history:** For each of these matches, a full **90-day time-series** is generated. This means there is a daily record capturing how demand signals, sales, and availability evolve from the day tickets go on sale until match day.
* **Zone-level granularity:** Each daily record is further broken down by **5 distinct seating zones**, each with its own capacity and base price, reflecting how different stadium areas have unique demand curves.

A key part of the strategy was to move beyond our internal sales history by enriching our models with external data. Through feature engineering, we combined our own historical performance data with real-world market signals‚Äîlike opponent rankings and social media hype‚Äîto create a more holistic and predictive view of market dynamics, resulting in a feature set combining **internal and external** data.

### Match Excitement Factor

To create a realistic dataset, the generation script doesn't just create random numbers. Instead, it simulates the underlying market dynamics by creating a unified **"Match Excitement Factor"**. This single variable acts as the primary driver for most of the demand signals in the dataset.

The logic is designed to mimic how a real fan's interest level would change based on the context of a match:

1.  **Starts with the opponent:** The excitement level begins with the quality of the opponent (`opponent_tier`). A top-tier opponent naturally generates more interest.

2.  **Adjusts for context:** The base excitement is then adjusted up or down based on several real-world factors:
    * **League position:** Excitement increases slightly if the team is high in the league standings.
    * **Player injuries:** Excitement decreases significantly if a star player is injured, especially for a high-profile match.
    * **Match importance:** Excitement drops for less meaningful matches, such as when the league winner is already known.
    * **Holidays & weekdays:** Matches near holidays get a boost in excitement, while weekday matches see a slight decrease.

3.  **Drives demand signals:** The final "Match Excitement Factor" is then used to generate all the other demand signals. For example, a match with a high excitement score will also have higher `google_trends_index`, more positive `social_media_sentiment`, and more `internal_search_trends`.


## Modeling

The goal is not just to build a black-box forecasting model, but to create a system that models the underlying drivers of ticket sales. By breaking down the problem into its constituent parts (time-series patterns, event-based impacts, external factors), we can better understand how each component contributes to the final outcome and more accurately quantify uncertainty. This approach of building a "driver tree" for the business, allows us to pinpoint the exact sources of error and continuously refine our understanding of the market.

This translates into a two-stage process: first **predict**, then **optimize**. The system first forecasts demand based on our business theory and then uses that forecast within a *Decision Engine* to find the optimal price.

### Stage 1: üìà Demand Forecasting

> This stage answers the business question: *"At a given price, how many tickets are we likely to sell?"*

| Aspect | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Model** | A hybrid **ensemble model** that combines `Prophet` and `XGBoost` in a residual fitting approach. |
| **Rationale** | This two-step model leverages the strengths of both algorithms. **Prophet** first models the core time-series components (trend, seasonality, and match-day effects). **XGBoost** then models the remaining variance (the residuals) using a rich feature set, capturing complex interactions that Prophet cannot. |
| **Features** | The model uses a rich set of internal and external factors‚Äìincluding historical sales, opponent tier, social media sentiment, and other engineered features‚Äìto build a comprehensive **"driver tree"** that explains demand. |
| **Application** | This trained model powers the *Impact Simulation* feature, allowing the commercial team to perform "what-if" analysis by inputting a hypothetical price and instantly seeing the likely impact on revenue and sales. |
| **Design Choice** | A hybrid model was chosen after testing multiple approaches, as the optimal forecasting method is never known beforehand. This ensemble was selected for its superior accuracy; it combines Prophet's strength in modeling core time-series trends with XGBoost's power to capture the remaining complex patterns, leading to a lower overall error. |

</br>

To ensure the final pricing decision is effective, the underlying demand forecast must be highly accurate. The primary goal was to minimize prediction error, evaluated against a **baseline model** (`DummyRegressor`). The key metric chosen was **WAPE**, as it provides a clear, interpretable measure of percentage error.

Determining the best forecasting method is only one half of the equation. We also need to estimate **prediction intervals**‚Äìthe upper and lower forecast values that the actual value is expected to fall between with a high probability. Prediction intervals are a function of how much data we have, the variation in that data, the forecast horizon, and the chosen model. They are crucial for risk assessment.

As this project uses a hybrid ensemble model, performance is evaluated on the **final, combined forecast**. The system first generates a baseline forecast with `Prophet`, then uses `XGBoost` to predict the remaining error (residuals). The final prediction (`Prophet forecast + XGBoost error forecast`) is then compared against the actual historical sales to derive the metrics below.

| Metric | Value | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **WAPE** (Primary Metric) | **19%** | **Why we chose it:** Weighted Absolute Percentage Error tells us the average forecast error in percentage terms, making it highly interpretable for revenue planning. A low WAPE is our main goal. |
| **R¬≤ Score** | **0.83** | **For model fit:** This shows that the model explains 83% of the variance in ticket sales, confirming it has a strong statistical fit to the data and learns the underlying patterns effectively. |
| **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** | **~254 tickets**| **For business context:** MAE tells us that, on average, our forecast is off by about 254 tickets. This gives stakeholders a concrete sense of the error margin in absolute units. |
| **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**| **~312 tickets**| **For robustness & uncertainty:** RMSE penalizes larger errors more heavily. A higher RMSE relative to MAE suggests the model occasionally makes larger prediction errors. This is critical for risk assessment and for estimating **prediction intervals** to understand the forecast's range of uncertainty. |

The performance was considered **successful**. A WAPE of 19% and an R¬≤ of 0.83 demonstrated a robust and reliable forecasting engine.

### Stage 2: ‚öôÔ∏è Price Optimization

> This stage answers the business question: *"What is the single best price to maximize total revenue?"*

| Aspect | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Model** | A custom *Optimization Engine* that performs an exhaustive grid search over a range of valid prices. |
| **Rationale** | A grid search is a reliable and straightforward method to find the optimal price within defined business constraints (e.g., price caps and floors). It guarantees finding the maximum projected revenue. |
| **Process** | The engine iterates through potential prices (e.g., from ‚Ç¨75 to ‚Ç¨350), uses the demand model to predict sales for each, calculates the projected revenue `(Price √ó Predicted Sales)`, and returns the optimal price. |
| **Output** | The engine's primary output is the official `Price Variation Proposal`, which is sent to the commercial team for review and approval. |
| **Design Choice**| Bayesian Optimization would likely find a near-optimal price much faster by intelligently exploring the price space. However, it doesn't guarantee finding the absolute maximum. For a critical business decision like pricing, **guaranteeing the optimal recommendation** (within the model's predictive power) is often more valuable than the computational speed gained from a heuristic approach. |

<details>

</br>

Since this is an optimization engine, not a predictive model, its performance is measured by its business value and efficiency.

| Metric | Measurement | Success Criteria |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Revenue lift** | Through A/B testing, comparing the revenue generated by the engine's prices against a control group. | A consistent, statistically significant increase in average revenue per match. |
| **Adoption rate** | Tracking the percentage of `Price Variation Proposals` that are reviewed and approved by the commercial team. | A high adoption rate (>80%) indicates that the team trusts and values the engine's recommendations. |
| **Computation time**| Measuring the time it takes for the grid search to complete for a given match. | The time must be within acceptable operational limits (<2') to allow for rapid, on-demand analysis by the commercial team. |

</details>

### Validation

Before a full rollout, the system was rigorously validated through a series of controlled **A/B tests** to scientifically measure its impact and mitigate risk. The core principle was to isolate the effect of the dynamic pricing engine from all other market variables. 

The results from the A/B tests confirmed our hypothesis, showing a consistent **+6% lift in average revenue** for the treatment group. Additionaly, this was achieved while also increasing the sell-through rate, demonstrating that the model was effective at finding the true market equilibrium. These conclusive, data-backed results gave the business full confidence to proceed with a full-scale rollout of the dynamic pricing system across all stadium zones.

<details>
<summary><b>Click to see the full experimental design</b></summary>

### Experimental Design

The validation used a segment-based A/B test, where different seating zones in the stadium were used as the unit of diversion to ensure a clean comparison.

1.  **Treatment vs. Control Groups**: The stadium was segmented into statistically similar groups of seating zones.
    * **Treatment Group = Dynamic Pricing**: A subset of zones had their prices set by the new automated engine. These prices could change daily based on the model's recommendations.
    * **Control Group = Static Pricing**: The remaining zones operated under the existing pricing strategy (e.g., prices set manually at the beginning of the season), serving as our baseline for comparison.

2.  **Hypothesis**: Our primary hypothesis was that the treatment group would generate a statistically significant lift in total revenue per match without negatively impacting the ticket sell-through rate compared to the control group.

3.  **Duration**: The tests were run over several matches of varying importance (e.g., high-demand league matches, lower-demand cup matches) to ensure the results were robust and not skewed by the unique characteristics of a single event.

### Key metrics tracked

To evaluate the experiment's outcome, we continuously monitored several KPIs for both groups:

* **Primary metric**: Avg. Revenue Per Seating Zone.
* **Secondary metrics**:
    * Ticket Sell-Through Rate (occupancy).
    * Avg. Ticket Price.
    * Sales Velocity (how quickly tickets sold).
