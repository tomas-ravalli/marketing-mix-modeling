## Overview

The core business problem originates with the club's membership model. Approximately 85% of the stadium's 100,000 seats are owned by season ticket holders (club members). This and other factors leaves only about 10% of stadium seats available for general sale from day one. Members who won't attend a match can release their seat back to the Club for resale via the official `Club Members App`.

  <br>
  <em>Fig. 1: Seat release for multiple matches from the Club's Members App.</em>
</p>

However, member behavior creates a massive supply-demand gap: **on average, 40% of members seats are released within the last 72 hours of a match**, while fan demand is already high months in advance. This mismatch leads to lost revenue, a poor fan experience with "not-available" messages, and fragmented single seats that are hard to sell. The diagram below illustrates the supply-demand gap the system was built to solve.

  <br>
  <em>Fig. 2: The supply-demand gap between early fan demand and late seat releases.</em>
</p>

The **Seats Availability Engine** (AKA SmartBooking) was designed to bridge this gap. It acts as a forecasting layer, using machine learning to predict how many seats will become available per stadium zone at various time horizons before match day. A **Ticketing Manager** then reviews this forecast, applies business logic and safety margins, and makes the final decision on how much inventory to push to the live ticketing system. This human-in-the-loop approach combines predictive power with expert oversight.

| 🚩 The Problem | 💡 The Solution |
| :--------------------------- | :---------------------------- |
| **"Not available" illusion**: Fans faced "not available" messages, unaware that new seats appear in the last 72 hours. | **Advance availability**: Predicts final seat count weeks in advance, allowing the club to sell tickets for seats that are not yet officially released. |
| **Lost revenue**: High, early demand went unmet due to the delay in seat releases, leading to significant lost revenue for the club. | **Revenue capture**: Unlocks millions in sales by matching early fan demand with manager-approved predicted inventory. |
| **Poor fan experience**: The unpredictable nature of ticket availability frustrated fans and fueled secondary resale markets. | **Guaranteed experience**: Offers fans, especially families and groups, guaranteed paired seating, improving satisfaction and trust. |
| **Seat fragmentation**: Last-minute releases often resulted in many isolated single seats that were difficult to sell. | **Optimized occupancy**: By selling seats early and guaranteeing pairs, the system reduces empty singles and maximizes attendance. |

### System synergy
The forecast generated by the Seat Availability Engine is a critical input for the club's **[Dynamic Pricing Engine](https://github.com/tomas-ravalli/fcb-dynamic-pricing)**. Knowing the true expected supply allows the pricing engine to move beyond simple static pricing and set optimal prices that accurately reflect real-time market conditions. This synergy between forecasting supply and optimizing price is what unlocks significant revenue growth.


## Dataset

To showcase a realistic data pipeline, this project uses two synthetic datasets: one for raw events and one for time-series modeling.

**1. Raw event data**: `club_members_app.csv`

This file simulates the raw data feed from the `Club Members App`, representing a **time-ordered event stream**. Each row is a single transaction with a `release_timestamp`, capturing the moment a season ticket holder releases their seat. This raw, event-level data provides the ground truth for the model's target variable and is the source from which all time-dependent features are engineered.

**2. Time-Series structured data**: `match_data_timeseries.csv`

This is the final, feature-rich dataset used to train the forecasting model, structured to allow for dynamic predictions at any point in time before a match. Its **granularity** is a **daily snapshot** per match and zone, meaning there is one row for Match 1, Zone A at 30 days before kick-off, another for 29 days, and so on. To create it, the data script transforms the raw event data into this time-series format. For each day, it calculates time-dependent features like **`seats_released_so_far`** and **`release_velocity_7d`** and then joins them with static contextual features like opponent and weather. The **target variable**, **`final_released_seats`**, represents the total number of seats that will ultimately be released for that match and zone. This value remains consistent across all daily snapshots for a given match.

### Features

The model uses a wide range of features, categorized to ensure a holistic view of supply and demand drivers.

| Category          | Features                                                                                 | Description                                                      |
| :---------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Match** | `weekday`, `month`, `kick-off_time`, `competition`, `is_weekend`                           | Core temporal and event-specific details for the match.          |
| **Opponent** | `opponent_position`, `is_derby`                                                          | Quantifies the opponent's quality and the match's rivalry level. |
| **Team Momentum** | `team_position`, `last_match_lost`, `goal_difference_last_5`, `top_player_injured`       | Captures the home team's recent performance and status.          |
| **Weather** | `is_rain`, `is_storm`, `is_wind`                                                         | Forecasted weather conditions that can influence attendance.     |
| **External** | `is_holiday`, `day_before_holiday`, `new_player_debuting`, `popular_concert_in_city` | External events and factors that can impact attendance decisions.|
> **`final_released_seats`**[Target Variable]: The final, total number of seats that were released by season ticket holders in that zone for that match. This is the value the model aims to predict.


### Match Excitement Factor

To create a realistic dataset, the generation script doesn't just create random numbers. Instead, it simulates the underlying market dynamics by creating a unified **"Match Excitement Factor"**. This single variable acts as the primary driver for most of the supply signals in the dataset.

The logic is designed to mimic how a real fan's interest level would change based on the context of a match:

1.  **Starts with the opponent:** The excitement level begins with the quality of the opponent (`opponent_tier`). A top-tier opponent naturally generates more interest.

2.  **Adjusts for context:** The base excitement is then adjusted up or down based on several real-world factors:
    * **League position:** Excitement increases slightly if the team is high in the league standings.
    * **Player injuries:** Excitement decreases significantly if a star player is injured, especially for a high-profile match.
    * **Match importance:** Excitement drops for less meaningful matches, such as when the league winner is already known.
    * **Holidays & weekdays:** Matches near holidays get a boost in excitement, while weekday matches see a slight decrease.

3.  **Drives demand signals:** The final "Match Excitement Factor" is then used to generate all the other demand signals. For example, a match with a high excitement score will also have higher `google_trends_index`, more positive `social_media_sentiment`, and more `internal_search_trends`.


## Modeling

The modeling approach is designed to provide dynamic forecasts that update over time. Instead of a single prediction, the system can answer the business question: *"Given everything we know **today**, how many seats will ultimately be released by club members?"*

### 📈 Dynamic Availability Forecasting

This approach creates a predictive asset that the business can use to make proactive decisions.

| Aspect | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Model** | An **`XGBoost` Regressor**. |
| **Rationale** | XGBoost excels at handling the mix of static and dynamic features in the time-series dataset. It can effectively model how the forecast should evolve as new information (like daily seat releases) becomes available closer to the match day. |
| **Features** | The model uses a rich set of features, including: <br> • **Static Features**: `opponent_position`, `is_derby`, etc. <br> • **Time-Dependent Features**: `days_until_match`, `seats_released_so_far`, `release_velocity_7d`. |
| **Application** | The model can generate a new forecast at **different time horizons** (e.g., daily). This allows the Ticketing Manager to monitor how the prediction evolves as new data becomes available and apply a safety buffer to the latest forecast, enabling more agile inventory management. |
| **Production Trade-offs** | The chosen model provides the best balance between **prediction accuracy**, **serving speed** (latency), and **inference cost**, ensuring strong performance in a live environment. |

The model was evaluated against simpler benchmarks to prove its value, as there was no intelligent system in place before to compare against:

| Source of Prediction | Accuracy |
| :--- | :--- |
| Averages (Mean, Median, etc.) | 45% |
| Domain Experts | 65% |
| **Machine Learning Model** | **84%** (R²) |

The model's **84% accuracy** provided a strong statistical foundation for the business to act on the forecasts with confidence. The model was also interpreted using **SHAP values** to ensure the relationships it learned were logical and explainable to stakeholders.

### Validation

Validating the model's business impact required moving beyond simple accuracy metrics to rigorously measure its causal effect on revenue. The core question was: "*Does using this model's forecast cause an increase in revenue?*"

To answer this, we implemented a two-fold validation framework. This approach confirmed a **+15% increase in total ticket sales revenue**, directly attributable to the Seat Availability ML system.

#### 1. Strategy

The first step was to frame the problem correctly. A simple A/B test comparing different matches is invalid due to confounding variables (opponent quality, weather, etc.). Our strategy therefore combined offline and online validation.

* **Offline validation (pre-flight check):** Before any real-world testing, we performed rigorous backtesting on historical data. This involved training the model on a period of data and evaluating its forecast accuracy on a hold-out set. We used SHAP values to interpret the model's predictions, ensuring it learned logical patterns and wasn't relying on spurious correlations. This validated the model's fundamental soundness.

* **Online validation (causal impact measurement):** To measure the real-world impact, we implemented a quasi-experimental design using **Propensity Score Matching (PSM)**. This statistical technique allowed us to create a fair, "apples-to-apples" comparison group from historical data, effectively simulating a controlled experiment to isolate the model's causal effect on revenue.

#### 2. Execution

This phase involved executing the PSM design to get a reliable measurement of the revenue lift.

* i. **Define groups**: We established two groups for our analysis:
    * **Treatment group**: A set of recent matches where the Ticketing Manager used the ML system forecast to release inventory.
    * **Control group**: A large pool of historical matches from seasons where the ML system did not exist.

* ii. **Build the propensity model**: We built a supervised classification model to calculate a "propensity score" for every match in both groups. This score quantifies the character of each match based on its features (opponent tier, competition, day of the week, etc.), representing the probability of it receiving the "treatment."

* iii. **Match & compare**: Using a nearest-neighbor matching algorithm, we found a "statistical twin" from the control group for each match in the treatment group. This twin was the historical match with the most similar propensity score, ensuring the comparison was fair.

* iv. **Define KPIs**: We measured the difference between the matched pairs across several metrics:
    * **Primary KPI**: Total Ticket Revenue.
    * **Secondary KPIs**: Final Attendance Rate, Average Order Value (AOV), and the sell-through rate of the predicted inventory.

This rigorous process gave us high confidence that the measured uplift was due to the ML system and not external or random factors.
